1)What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
 .gitIgnore is a file created by Github if chosen to, where developers can define which files/directories of code  should be ignored/not uploaded by Github on the remote repository. It is generally used for files which are specific to user's local configurations for development for ex .project file of eclipse IDE. It may also include heavy packages/libraries files (.jar, .tar.gz, .zip etc) which might not be needed on the remote repository.

2)What does fast-forward in Git mean?
  fast-forward in Git is a way of combining/merging code between two branches. It is used when there are no conflicts between the target branch and the branch to be merged. For example: On your local test branch you made some commits. However while doing git pull origin test, there were some new commits on the origin/test branch which will throw a conflict. Now these two cannot be fast-forward merged and conflicts will need to be resolved first. Had these two not diverged, git would have automatically integrated them by fast-forward.

3)Why should you have different branches?
  Github provides the functionality of creating different branches in a repository. This allows simultaneous development/working on the project without worrying about code duplicacy, having the latest code, code conflicts etc. For example: Two developers can cut their owm feature branches from the main branch and work simultaneously without worrying about the other's work.

4)In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
  A git project can have multiple repositories. Usually one repository is sufficient for small scale projects, however there are cases when one repository cannot handle all the code base. Such an example is the Android project (1000+ repositories).
